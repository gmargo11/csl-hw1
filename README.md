# Instructions
To run the code for this homework, clone this repository into a system with a python3 environment including airobot and gym. The file "run_ppo.py" will train the reacher environment with PPO.

# Acknowledgements
The gym environment templates used for training were provided by the 6.884 staff. Code for PPO training is adapted from OpenAI's stable-baselines library.
