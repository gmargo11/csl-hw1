# Computational Sensorimotor Learning HW1
Gabriel Margolis

## Dependencies
The code will run in any python3 environment with airobot, gym, and tensorflow installed. Simply clone this repository onto your system and run the main training files.

## Problem 1
The code for learning a policy for the reacher environment with PPO is in: learn_reacher_ppo.py

## Problem 2
The code for learning a policy for the reacher_wall environment with PPO is in: learn_reacher_wall_ppo.py

## Problem 3
The code for learning a policy for the pusher enviornment with PPO is in: learn_pusher_ppo.py

## Acknowledgements
The gym environment templates used for training were provided by the 6.884 staff. Code for PPO training is adapted from OpenAI's stable baselines library.
